## About me

Hi all! My name is Will Newbegin and I'm a rising senior at Lehigh University from the Allentown, PA area. I study Science Writing and Environmental Studies with a double-minor in Data Science and Applied Mathematics. At Lehigh, I keep busy with extracirriculars such as the TRAC Fellow Writing Program, Greek Life, and working with Lehigh's Brown and White. 

I have been writing for the news for, say, 7-8 years now and have loved pretty much every second of it. Journalism has prodvided me the opportunity to write in a variety of mediums and for a variety of audiences. It's taken me courtside in basketball games and curbside during protests. My favorite report is always the next one.

In my spare time, I really enjoy reading, writing, riding my bike, hiking, and playing video games. I really like action, comedy and horror movies, and I obsess over music too -- I used to write a column for the Brown and White about music when I had a little bit more spare time. 

Professionally, I'm really interested in the intersection between science, technology, society and politics. Not really sure where that'll take me, though graduate school seems like a fine option at this point (I don't imagine the job market looking too friendly next summer thanks to COVID-19). I also really enjoy learning about language and the way that humans learn language and how it serves as a window into the human mind. So when it comes to grad school, I guess I have some options :)

Looking forward to meeting the rest of you!
